# Flappy-Ocean
Godot Flappy Bird-like game

# Info

Made using Godot 3.3 and GDScript.
Sprites made with Aseprite and non-pixel assets made with Krita.
All art assets were made by me (as you can probably tell), and you're free to do whatever you want with any part of this project, art included. 

The project is under the MIT license, and all art is under the CC0 license.

**Disclaimer:** This project was made as an experiment and to learn how to use Godot. The code will likely not be as efficient as it could be, and the game might be incomplete. I've made this open-source just in case anyone wants to have a look at how I've done this, as it might be able to help someone.

I also do not plan on maintaining this project after I'm done with it, but if you want to open any issues or PRs, I would happily take a look at them.
